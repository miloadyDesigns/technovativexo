										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting a website designed and developed is not enough; your newly launched website requires consistent maintenance. Updating your website is essential if you want to keep your visitors engaged. Secondly, maintenance is vital to identify whether your site is performing ideally or lacking somewhere. Keeping the website maintained and updated is not everyone&#8217;s piece of the cake; additionally, only experts can handle such technical tasks. So, partnering up with an experienced, trusted <a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development"><strong>website maintenance company</strong></a> is always the best solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are countless IT support companies, but choosing the right web maintenance company is complicated. It requires you to consider all the essential factors like service quality, experience, budget, customer service, and others. Here we provide some valuable tips on choosing the best website maintenance partner for constantly updating your business site. </span></p>
<h2><b>What Are Website Maintenance Services?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your website may look normal, but deep down, it must suffer from severe technical issues affecting your business&#8217;s day-to-day operations. To keep a website up to date, websites need consistent maintenance. When it comes to custom web development, it is necessarily dependent on maintenance as, over time, the software and code can get outdated, which can only be fixed by getting maintenance services. Taking website maintenance services non-seriously can worsen your site’s performance, and your users&#8217; experience can become unpleasant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://geeksroot.com/"><strong>Website maintenance services</strong></a> are an integral part of web development and maintenance. The process includes tasks like website software updates service, data backup, malware scanning, vulnerability scanning, security patches, content and images updates service, and more. These services are offered by IT firms or web development and maintenance companies. The companies aim to serve the best web maintenance services and ensure that the websites perform well and are secure.</span></p>
<h2><b>How To Choose a Website Maintenance Company: 7 Best Tips</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, there are countless IT support firms. Similarly, it&#8217;s always important to spend time researching the best one that suits your needs before hiring. Here are some things that you should keep in mind when choosing a website maintenance company. </span></p>
<h3><b>Identify What Your Requirements Are</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before finalizing a web maintenance company, the wise act is to identify the needs of your business website. Every company has its different service packages that include multiple maintenance services. So, you must first decide which service you want and then approach a specific company to get the same. Ask yourself these questions before even starting to research a web maintenance partner.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What elements do I need to be updated? Files? Content? Images? Or other.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can my team manage writing blogs internally, or should I prefer a web maintenance company to write blogs for us?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much time per week do I want service providers to spend on my website maintenance?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can I manage the search engine optimization of my site, or should I go for assistance from a service provider?</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Research About The Service Provider You Are Going To Work With</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you find the right company, it&#8217;s essential to ask about its development history and identify whether the company is reliable and professional enough to support you ideally. Additionally, communicate with the agency properly, ask about their goals and future development plans, and compare it with your expectations. </span></p>
<h3><b>Learn What Services Your Maintenance Company Offers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s better to pick a website maintenance company that offers multiple services, can adopt fast-changing trends and can keep your website updated. For instance, if you plan to collaborate with a full-service maintenance company, ensure that the company will offer you vital services. These services include website speed testing, identifying broken links, checking for 404 errors, software/plugin updates, reviewing website security, creating blog content, analyzing the website&#8217;s overall performance, and others.</span></p>
<h3><b>Check Company&#8217;s Prior Experience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main factor to consider before hiring a website maintenance service provider is experience. If you hire an experienced company, you will work with a professional and highly skilled team. The experienced team can effortlessly understand your requirements and provide the best results. Further, they will analyze the website deeply and recommend some necessary actions to boost your website performance. In contrast, choosing an untrained company can lead you to more trouble, and your website performance can worsen. Hence, you need to find a trustworthy company that can understand your unique requirements and delivers the best solution possible.</span></p>
<h3><b>Find Out Their Rates</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s best than finding a company that aligns with all your website’s requirements and is within your budget? Consider a website maintenance company with various pricing plans for small startups to business tycoons. Finalize one that is capable of providing the best services to your website within your budget. </span></p>
<h3><b>Beware Of Cheap Packages</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is recommended to beware of cheap packages because hiring a low-cost company can create numerous severe problems for your website. Remember that a good IT company usually offers expensive services, so always stay realistic. A cheap price plan can look more attractive to you, but it can affect the quality of work you get. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, your focus should always be on quality rather than on getting cheap website maintenance services.</span></p>
<h3><b>Watch The Contract Terms</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When approaching a service provider, both parties must sign an agreement consisting of all the mandatory information, like the client&#8217;s specific requirements, definitions, and timetables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the most important for you is to read the company’s contract terms and conditions carefully to avoid future inconveniences. Therefore, the contract should contain the start date and end date of service and other requirements.</span></p>
<h2><b>Final Words</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining your website is daunting and requires you to pay complete attention and spend time and resources. However, picking the right website maintenance company can make things simpler for you and can ideally maintain your business website. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it&#8217;s about designing or developing a website, an extreme level of expertise and experience are always required. It&#8217;s a full-time job requiring a <a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>website development company</strong></a> or freelancer to multitask, use a limited time span, and deliver top-notch results. A perfectly designed and developed website can effortlessly give the client’s business idea life and enable his business to bloom. But what&#8217;s the right path to getting first-class website development services? Numerous freelancers and web development companies claim to be perfect for developing your site. However, trusting blindly on any freelancer or company is not something to appreciate. You must spend some time researching whether you need to hire a freelance developer for this role or should approach a software development agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To clear up your confusion, we have compared the roles and expertise of a freelancer and a web development agency in this guide. After reading this article, you can decide which is best for your next project. </span></p>
<h2><b>Website Development Company VS Freelancer</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing a web development agency or a freelancer depends on your business goals, budget, and specific needs. Working with freelance developers and IT web development companies has advantages and disadvantages. Undeniably, it can be a tough decision to pick one for your business project. Following are some points that can assist you ideally in differentiating between working with a freelancer and a website development company. So, check out.</span></p>
<h3><b>Skills And Expertise</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, a development company works with several team members with high skills and expertise in website development, website maintenance, <a href="https://geeksroot.com/blog/which-one-is-best-shopify-or-magento/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ecommerce website development</strong></a>, cms development, and others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, hiring a company means your project will be handled by a designated project manager who directs the team of developers about your business requirements. In contrast, if you opt for a freelance developer, you will have to assign your project’s multiple tasks to a single person. Similarly, the freelancer will be solely responsible for designing, developing, and testing processes. In this case, the results can be disappointing, and you can face multiple challenges with your site. Whereas, if a specialized team is there to do the job, there may be little risk of mistakes. The development company owns years of experience and expertise in working on various projects, so it can effortlessly fix the problems related to your site. </span></p>
<h3><b>Communication And Deadlines</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The web development agency has a certain level of professionalism; the staff listens appropriately to your requirements and suggests some best options. Throughout the project, you will observe strong communication and commitment from a website development company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, a freelance developer directly communicates with the client; he clears all his confusion about the project. But if a freelancer does multiple jobs simultaneously or any of the project’s nature is bulky, he may take the client&#8217;s extended time to understand the project. However, to minimize the hassle, the client can hire a project manager to convey the project’s requirements to the freelancer to avoid misunderstandings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let&#8217;s discuss deadlines; a freelancer or a good development company would never want to make the client angry. So, both try hard to submit the project on time, but bad luck can strike anytime with any of them. Mostly, freelancers couldn&#8217;t be able to adhere to strict timelines, while companies have an organized working environment, so they are most likely to submit the projects on time. </span></p>
<h3><b>Quality</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever service you are taking, your main goal must be quality. Similarly, the quality of web designs and development matters when you want your business to thrive. The website that you need should contain an attractive theme, be mobile responsive, and be user-friendly. Also, the website should be capable enough to attract customers ideally. If a freelancer or website development company is able enough to fulfill all your business requirements and can provide you with quality work, then you can consider hiring them. Usually, a freelancer cannot provide the quality work that a web design agency can. Moreover, an expert team will be responsible for building your web design and development with quality, while the freelancer will only focus on completing the job on time.  </span></p>
<h3><b>Costs Of Services</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, approaching web development agencies are expensive than hiring a freelancer. However, you need to consider that several diversely skilled and qualified people will work on your project when you approach a website dev company. In comparison, a freelancer has expertise in specific areas but costs less for their services. A company can be expensive, but it consists of a wide variety of developers and marketing managers who can create the best product for your business. Investing a little more is also best when your focus is the quality. </span></p>
<h3><b>Replaceability</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approaching a company means getting ultimate services from an expert and highly qualified developers team. A project manager will assign your project to someone with similar expertise and knowledge. If somehow the developer finds some issues and is unable to fix those issues, then a project manager will replace the current developer with another one having similar skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In comparison, working with a freelance developer means you dont have any backup plan; he can anytime leave the project in between for any severe or urgent reasons. He may refuse to work on your project, and you have to face delays and disappointments. Similarly, you are risking the sustainability of your essential web development projects. Therefore, it would be uneasy for you to replace the freelance developer with anyone quickly if he cannot delegate your task. </span></p>
<h3><b>Security And Reliability</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this vast technological time, security is highly essential for anyone. Similarly, as a business owner, you will always want to collaborate with someone who keeps confidentiality and security seriously. Web development agencies understand the condition; they have a whole team who keeps your data up to date. They provide ultimate protection to their clients and keep the information confidential. Whereas working with a freelancer means you can expect anything, they take your project as a side job and don&#8217;t care much about it. A freelancer can be consistent and committed to their work but cannot be reliable. It&#8217;s hard for freelancers to provide the ultimate level of security, they can disappear anytime, and you might face sudden panic. On the other hand, development companies know their reputation and client safety are interconnected, so they seriously care about the client’s security concerns. </span></p>
<h2><b>Website Development Company vs Freelancer: Which One Is the Better Option?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, hiring a freelance developer or a full-scale web development agency depends on your business goals and the project’s nature. Still, there are a few main points that you need to look at. A freelancer only focuses on strictly defined purposes; he does not provide you the continuous support and website maintenance services. The only advantage of hiring a freelancer is that he offers the best prices and wouldn&#8217;t cost you an arm and a leg. On the other hand, a development company is sufficient to build a top-notch website and provide long-term continuous support to your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a web development agency is registered with a large team of experts and project managers who can manage larger workloads and projects effortlessly. So, hiring a website development company is a better choice in terms of painless process and quality. Therefore, investing a little more time and money is always best to receive a product that can make your business thrive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at </span><a href="https://geeksroot.com/get-quote" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Geeks Root</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we offer services with cutting-edge technologies that can simply take your business to the next level.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we can witness the latest and updated information with every single tap. A simple website or application having plain text and a boring theme is not what people like nowadays. Any website or application should consist of engaging, user-friendly elements to surf well in the vast ocean of the internet. To maintain the requirements of rapidly developing technology, some new-age developers worked hard to build something top-notch yet user-friendly to ease the programmer&#8217;s tasks. Therefore, developers invented the faster and more operative website development framework of Javascript, Mean Stack. The benefit is that the main stack works best in easing the job of developers and users. This purpose-serving framework stands at the peak of demands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in becoming a mean stack developer, you should first learn what a mean stack, its components, and its benefits are, then decide whether pursuing a role in this field is right for you or not. Here we have rounded up the complete guide about mean stack and <a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development"><strong>mean stack developer</strong></a>, sharing details about the skills required and others.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Mean Stack?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perfect solution for creating dynamic applications and websites is the user-friendly stack called “Mean Stack.” The mean stack, aka a collection of JavaScript technologies, is used to develop fast and robust web-based applications and primarily for cloud-ready applications. MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js. Thus, from client to server and from server to database, everything in the mean stack framework is based on JavaScript.</span></p>
<h3><b>Components of Mean Stack</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four technology pieces in the mean stack include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>MongoDB </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">express is a NoSQL database system which does not contain relations or schema options. Additionally, it consists of a coherent way of sorting out data in a highly organized matter. You can save a large amount of unorganized data here by using JavaScript.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Express JS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a framework used to build websites and web applications in Node.js. The framework allows users to create the website in the most customizable way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this incredible platform is open source; you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can use Express JS to retrieve data, query databases or responses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>AngularJS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a JavaScript open-source framework for front-end activities developed by Google. The framework is used to formulate one-page sites and applications; also, you can fix web application bugs and resolve front-end issues with Angular JS.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Node.js</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a super easy back-end platform capable of reading and executing code to help function sites and web applications. You can use this framework to create any sort of website and application; the best part is its readily available and open-source platform. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>What is Mean Stack Developer?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mean stack developer is a technical professional with vast expertise in stack tools. In addition, mean developers have extensive knowledge of JavaScript frameworks and associated programs to create top-notch websites and applications. The mean developers&#8217; specialty is working on both the front-end and back-end of JavaScript applications. There are several responsibilities of a mean developer that include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architect, test, and create robust, highly responsive applications that can grow in size quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design and maintain large, complex databases for clients where they can store or retrieve data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify and fix production and non-production application issues as part of the deployment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrate and establish existing applications with other sites and software as needed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deploy applications on AWS cloud with the ability to remove errors and other hosting-related issues. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Mean Stack Developer VS Full-Stack Developer</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mean developer is a full stack developer that focuses and uses MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js for website creation. They have knowledge of some specific parts of <a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development"><strong>web development</strong></a>. In contrast, full-stack developers know all web development stages but are not experts on all layers of development. Full-stack developers only possess the functional knowledge and expertise that helps them build a web application. In addition, the full-stack developers contain vast skills in basic web technologies like CSS/HTML, JavaScript, databases, back-end language, and web storage. Moreover, they have knowledge of web application architecture, HTTP, basic algorithms and data structures, REST, and Git.</span></p>
<h2><b>Skills That a Mean Stack Developer Should Have</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are numerous essential skills that a mean developer should have if he wants to excel in their role. Try following these skills to be an expert in mean development and pursue this career ideally.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>JavaScript: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, mean stack is all about JavaScript, which means if you want to become a mean stack developer, you should have command of the JavaScript coding language. Deep knowledge of JavaScript is essential; you must know coding and should be aware of using related tools, including third-party libraries and databases. </span></li>
<li><b>Mean Stack Expertise:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ability to work with MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js.</span></li>
<li><b>Web Technologies:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To become a mean developer, you should have the necessary knowledge of web technologies like internet servers, protocols, and cloud technology.

<p>Are you wondering about having your platform to market your product? Is the deal between <strong><a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shopify and Magento</a></strong> averse? We will search through the integrations they relate at the ratio of finding this comparison to be answered with a suitable answer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magento</h2>



<p>An eCommerce platform where you have the leverage to market your product based on various professional revivals, Magento is a platform where business officials are obliged to work at coding interprets. Moreover, on a Business marketing basis, Magento is a great substitute for reaching out through B2B to B2C integrations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Shopify</h2>



<p>Listing the probabilities, Shopify is the most versatile platform for a sole proprietorship. Businesses starting from scratch; you opt to sell your products with low pricing delegations. Shopify is your place; you&#8217;re provided with ease of socializing your product and with the best combinations. Foremost, Shopify has linked Oberlo, opting to serve you many features in running your product to reach the customers at hand.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which Is Best: Shopify or Magento?</h2>



<p>Listing these chances, Shopify and Magento being the best eCommerce platform of this age, have an upsurge of similarities and dissimilarities; you find them at ease to run your business essentials. They provide you with the best platform. But, some points make one different from another. The difference depends on functionality, prices, theme extracts, add-ons, advertisements, and sales.</p>



<p>Ominous to these verdicts is the potential sense of giving this liberty to the businesses to run on an easy probability of reaching the targeted market. We must look through many variations and have the liberty to customize and combine the designed optimizations that attract other platforms to do business and upgrade at best.</p>



<p>Shopify putting ideal and rare deals to manage their reputation has resulted in multiple sourcing domains. Firstly, Shopify plans to flourish in the market by uprooting a great percentage of users in plenty of running businesses like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. While Magento eCommerce has many businesses prompts, it&#8217;s easy to understand professional web coding.</p>



<p>These verdicts enlarge the overall pacing of both platforms to have a rundown value and become cost-effective, flexible, and ideally approachable for the audience. Still, both lose something and have virtuous phenomena in another.</p>



<p>We can see the ratio of installation category to both platforms; Shopify takes the win-win centrum in most of these integrations, making it the right choice for the user to pursue. Both platforms have unwillingly paced the structural work to lookup the marketing strategy crashing with one another. Also, it can identify both the domains to have real deal functionality structure.</p>



<p>Enhancement of interest from both ends- consumer and business, both of these mediums play an important role in the development. The possibility is that Magento and Shopify are providing the audience the liberty. Professionals witness Shopify allows a minor to have access, whereas Magento licensing is a must-to-have entity.</p>



<p>Pricing depends on the features and add-ons; Shopify gives the audience leverage to work on a 14-days free trial. Meanwhile, Magento is diligently making the user control their audience and requires learning indictments.</p>



<p>These giants offer progressive services with open-sourcing effects; Shopify and Magento have set their standards concrete. Shopify takes the lead position and takes over an equal ratio with performance conclusions, making these possible integrations.</p>



<p>Many innovative developments are incorporated with dealt integrations; <strong><a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e Commerce services</a></strong> are useful to the user, including UI motion, support-to-code optimization, AMP (Accelerated Mobile Page), etc. which are th3e features of Shopify. On the other hand, Magento offers gripping and rightful integrations in the e-Commerce services that keep it in the marketplace. When e-Commerce is the subject, primary and underlining features matter a lot, but the improvements they offer to their characteristics are best in both platforms. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Verdict</h2>



<p>Shopify and Magento keep evolving because they have a broad range of improvising space- many improvements have been made. In contrast, many are on their way to integration and executions. So it will be easy for consumers to look at what you&#8217;re looking for and find the right deal to move forward with your business with the above features. Moreover, a business&#8217;s necessary attractiveness to reach out to trillions of other <strong><a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eCommerce professional developments</a></strong> has accelerated it. So they&#8217;re upgrading in the high range with these platforms. Have to look at a complete image of these transitions, search it away, and enjoy the journey ahead to success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>People are constantly confused when using terms of the technological realm like&#8221;<strong>web designer</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>web developer</strong>.&#8221; Even though both jobs are from the same industry, i.e., the computer sciences (information and computer technology) world, the difference between them is as clearly visibly different as the sun and moon. Both of these jobs require highly-competitive, logical, and analytical skillsets.</p>



<p>People with sharp minds who can easily comprehend the logical aspects of Web development and have a knack for artistic sights work on both of these jobs simultaneously, but both these jobs are opposites. Instead, they are complementary. So when people use the terms &#8220;<em>web designer&#8221;</em>&nbsp;vs. &#8220;<em>web developer</em>&#8221; conversely, they are stirring a hornet&#8217;s nest because this is unjustifiable.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to understand Web designing; a business needs an entire team to design and launch a complex, interactive website. For Web Development, a team of a minimum of two and a maximum of fifteen members fifteen (or more) is required.</p>



<p>The Web Development professi<a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">onals</a> involved in the procedure include web designers, copywriters, web developers, SEO professionals, or if unsure, hire dedicated developers for projects. Branding and branding strategy is part of the same process too. Thus, it&#8217;s easy to see how misunderstanding emerges when analyzing what a web designer does differently from a web developer and vice-versa. To make things understandable and use these terms correctly, this article is here to make things more obvious.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Web Designer</h2>



<p><a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web designing</a> is just about anything that requires an aesthetic eye and artistic flair. Moreover, web designers work with the visuals of a website while also ensuring that the site is user-friendly and straightforward so visitors can interact with it.</p>



<p>The job of a Web designer is critical- they need to make sure that visitors&#8217; retention rate keeps on increasing; they must be able to find things they wish quick and spend more time on a website. To do this, they analyze the most modern trends in web design, acknowledge design principles and standards, follow users&#8217; demands explicitly while making the website, and much more. Web designers generate layouts and visuals that are visually appealing for the visitors while keeping in mind how they will feel while browsing the site.</p>



<p>There are three categories of Web Designers: UX, UI, and VD/GD (Visual/<a href="https://geeksroot.com/graphic-design.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Graphic Designer</a>). Here&#8217;s a short description of them:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.geeksroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/web-designer-vs-web-developer-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-61" srcset="https://geeksroot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/web-designer-vs-web-developer-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://geeksroot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/web-designer-vs-web-developer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://geeksroot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/web-designer-vs-web-developer-768x512.jpg 768w, https://geeksroot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/web-designer-vs-web-developer-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://geeksroot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/web-designer-vs-web-developer-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">User Experience (UX)</h2>



<p>User Experience (UX) designers ensure that a website keeps visitors engaged and boosts organic traffic. They carefully evaluate data and information and trends before putting things into practice. Furthermore, UX designers run complexly detailed assessments and streamline the websites to optimize the user experience for better sales and company reputation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">User Interface (UI)</h2>



<p>User Interface (UI) designers handle how well users can interact with the features present on the website. The User Interface (UI) is everything visitors see when visiting a website. Therefore, the website needs to be visually appealing and seamlessly fit to get the expected workflow.</p>



<p>A UX and a UI designer&#8217;s responsibilities can be combined into one job, making an individual profile – the Visual/GraphicDesigner. Visual Design produces visually attractive and suitable interfaces for visitors to use. Also, they must keep in mind the needs and requirements of the brand.Visual/Graphic design skills include both creativity and coding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Web Developer &amp; Development</h2>



<p>The definition of a web development developer is reasonably related to that of a web designer. Web developers have an essential role in website development and creation. They manage the process&#8217;s execution and implementation stages. After deciphering the goals and structure of the website, web developers can go into the next phase to transform the concept and make it a reality.</p>



<p>Understanding the Web Designer vs.Web Developer comparison hinges on this distinction mentioned above.</p>



<ul><li>To bring every aspect of the wbsite together, let&#8217;s take a look at a quick breakdown of the most significant distinctions between these two roles:</li><li>Web designers focus on look, usability, and appearance, whereas web developers focus on the functionality and structure of the website.</li><li>Web designers conceptualize the website&#8217;s look, designing a prototype based on graphical, UX, and UI features. Then, web development specialists determine whether the concept is fiscally and technically credible, program and code the website.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Web developers require a substantial amount of technical knowledge. It is because it contains understanding new and complex programming languages and frameworks. However, research and analysis showed that web designer&#8217;s role is less technical and all about visual and creative elements.</li></ul>



<ul><li>There are different categories of web developers, including Front-end, Back-end, and Full-stack Developers. However, UX, UI, and Graphic/Visual designers are the three principal web designers.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The tools and programs used by web developers include programming libraries and frameworks, coding QA and versioning, error/bug tracking platforms such as GitHub, hosting management panels, FTP clients, and CMSs. However, web designers usually use design editing software such as Photoshop, WordPress (or any other CMS), a website builder such as Elementor, and wireframing/prototyping tools.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Web developers and designers are responsible for developing, deploying, and maintaining websites. But ultimately, the two functions depend on each other to deliver a quality product.</li></ul>



<p>The main difference is that <a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web Development</a> focuses on the website&#8217;s technical attributes, such as programming. On the other hand, Web designers manage the visuals and conceptual workings; necessary to ensure a solid UX and UI customer experience.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Back-End Development</h3>



<p>Through this web development type, you can maintain content behind the scenes to keep your website running smoothly. These developers write codes to ensure that data flows from the front end to the back end. When updating prices or starting promotions, product and price information will be updated in the database and then published on the website. When you process the transaction, everything will go great because the back-end developers do just that.</p>



<p>The responsibility of the back-end developers is to build the logical part of the entire website. This web development is an integral part of any site as multiple programming languages ​​are used. The code written by these developers forms the basis of the website and the applications it contains. They make websites load fast, which is an important aspect of SEO and user experiences. Therefore, when you operate on the website, the website will be configured accordingly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Front-End Development</h3>



<p>Being one of the web-developments types, this is the process of designing the user interface of a site using web technologies for instance JavaScript and HTML. In short, front-end web development makes it easier for visitors to read web content. To create a decent website interface, these developers must also write efficient codes.</p>



<p>They are accountable for creating the interactive components of the site and designing the text, colors, and images. Have you ever seen a button that changes color when you click on something on the page? They make sure that everything you see is useful as they bring their coding expertise to life. They make sure that all links are working in the right place and that the website is responsive. You can also add schemes to your website, and you must understand exactly what customers want on their website.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Full-Stack Development</h3>
