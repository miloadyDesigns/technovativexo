										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it&#8217;s about designing or developing a website, an extreme level of expertise and experience are always required. It&#8217;s a full-time job requiring a <a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>website development company</strong></a> or freelancer to multitask, use a limited time span, and deliver top-notch results. A perfectly designed and developed website can effortlessly give the client’s business idea life and enable his business to bloom. But what&#8217;s the right path to getting first-class website development services? Numerous freelancers and web development companies claim to be perfect for developing your site. However, trusting blindly on any freelancer or company is not something to appreciate. You must spend some time researching whether you need to hire a freelance developer for this role or should approach a software development agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To clear up your confusion, we have compared the roles and expertise of a freelancer and a web development agency in this guide. After reading this article, you can decide which is best for your next project. </span></p>
<h2><b>Website Development Company VS Freelancer</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing a web development agency or a freelancer depends on your business goals, budget, and specific needs. Working with freelance developers and IT web development companies has advantages and disadvantages. Undeniably, it can be a tough decision to pick one for your business project. Following are some points that can assist you ideally in differentiating between working with a freelancer and a website development company. So, check out.</span></p>
<h3><b>Skills And Expertise</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, a development company works with several team members with high skills and expertise in website development, website maintenance, <a href="https://geeksroot.com/blog/which-one-is-best-shopify-or-magento/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ecommerce website development</strong></a>, cms development, and others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, hiring a company means your project will be handled by a designated project manager who directs the team of developers about your business requirements. In contrast, if you opt for a freelance developer, you will have to assign your project’s multiple tasks to a single person. Similarly, the freelancer will be solely responsible for designing, developing, and testing processes. In this case, the results can be disappointing, and you can face multiple challenges with your site. Whereas, if a specialized team is there to do the job, there may be little risk of mistakes. The development company owns years of experience and expertise in working on various projects, so it can effortlessly fix the problems related to your site. </span></p>
<h3><b>Communication And Deadlines</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The web development agency has a certain level of professionalism; the staff listens appropriately to your requirements and suggests some best options. Throughout the project, you will observe strong communication and commitment from a website development company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, a freelance developer directly communicates with the client; he clears all his confusion about the project. But if a freelancer does multiple jobs simultaneously or any of the project’s nature is bulky, he may take the client&#8217;s extended time to understand the project. However, to minimize the hassle, the client can hire a project manager to convey the project’s requirements to the freelancer to avoid misunderstandings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let&#8217;s discuss deadlines; a freelancer or a good development company would never want to make the client angry. So, both try hard to submit the project on time, but bad luck can strike anytime with any of them. Mostly, freelancers couldn&#8217;t be able to adhere to strict timelines, while companies have an organized working environment, so they are most likely to submit the projects on time. </span></p>
<h3><b>Quality</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever service you are taking, your main goal must be quality. Similarly, the quality of web designs and development matters when you want your business to thrive. The website that you need should contain an attractive theme, be mobile responsive, and be user-friendly. Also, the website should be capable enough to attract customers ideally. If a freelancer or website development company is able enough to fulfill all your business requirements and can provide you with quality work, then you can consider hiring them. Usually, a freelancer cannot provide the quality work that a web design agency can. Moreover, an expert team will be responsible for building your web design and development with quality, while the freelancer will only focus on completing the job on time.  </span></p>
<h3><b>Costs Of Services</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, approaching web development agencies are expensive than hiring a freelancer. However, you need to consider that several diversely skilled and qualified people will work on your project when you approach a website dev company. In comparison, a freelancer has expertise in specific areas but costs less for their services. A company can be expensive, but it consists of a wide variety of developers and marketing managers who can create the best product for your business. Investing a little more is also best when your focus is the quality. </span></p>
<h3><b>Replaceability</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approaching a company means getting ultimate services from an expert and highly qualified developers team. A project manager will assign your project to someone with similar expertise and knowledge. If somehow the developer finds some issues and is unable to fix those issues, then a project manager will replace the current developer with another one having similar skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In comparison, working with a freelance developer means you dont have any backup plan; he can anytime leave the project in between for any severe or urgent reasons. He may refuse to work on your project, and you have to face delays and disappointments. Similarly, you are risking the sustainability of your essential web development projects. Therefore, it would be uneasy for you to replace the freelance developer with anyone quickly if he cannot delegate your task. </span></p>
<h3><b>Security And Reliability</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this vast technological time, security is highly essential for anyone. Similarly, as a business owner, you will always want to collaborate with someone who keeps confidentiality and security seriously. Web development agencies understand the condition; they have a whole team who keeps your data up to date. They provide ultimate protection to their clients and keep the information confidential. Whereas working with a freelancer means you can expect anything, they take your project as a side job and don&#8217;t care much about it. A freelancer can be consistent and committed to their work but cannot be reliable. It&#8217;s hard for freelancers to provide the ultimate level of security, they can disappear anytime, and you might face sudden panic. On the other hand, development companies know their reputation and client safety are interconnected, so they seriously care about the client’s security concerns. </span></p>
<h2><b>Website Development Company vs Freelancer: Which One Is the Better Option?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, hiring a freelance developer or a full-scale web development agency depends on your business goals and the project’s nature. Still, there are a few main points that you need to look at. A freelancer only focuses on strictly defined purposes; he does not provide you the continuous support and website maintenance services. The only advantage of hiring a freelancer is that he offers the best prices and wouldn&#8217;t cost you an arm and a leg. On the other hand, a development company is sufficient to build a top-notch website and provide long-term continuous support to your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a web development agency is registered with a large team of experts and project managers who can manage larger workloads and projects effortlessly. So, hiring a website development company is a better choice in terms of painless process and quality. Therefore, investing a little more time and money is always best to receive a product that can make your business thrive. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we can witness the latest and updated information with every single tap. A simple website or application having plain text and a boring theme is not what people like nowadays. Any website or application should consist of engaging, user-friendly elements to surf well in the vast ocean of the internet. To maintain the requirements of rapidly developing technology, some new-age developers worked hard to build something top-notch yet user-friendly to ease the programmer&#8217;s tasks. Therefore, developers invented the faster and more operative website development framework of Javascript, Mean Stack. The benefit is that the main stack works best in easing the job of developers and users. This purpose-serving framework stands at the peak of demands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in becoming a mean stack developer, you should first learn what a mean stack, its components, and its benefits are, then decide whether pursuing a role in this field is right for you or not.

<h3><b>Components of Mean Stack</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four technology pieces in the mean stack include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>MongoDB </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">express is a NoSQL database system which does not contain relations or schema options. Additionally, it consists of a coherent way of sorting out data in a highly organized matter. You can save a large amount of unorganized data here by using JavaScript.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Express JS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a framework used to build websites and web applications in Node.js. The framework allows users to create the website in the most customizable way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this incredible platform is open source; you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can use Express JS to retrieve data, query databases or responses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>AngularJS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a JavaScript open-source framework for front-end activities developed by Google.
