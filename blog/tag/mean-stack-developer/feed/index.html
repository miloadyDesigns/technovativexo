										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we can witness the latest and updated information with every single tap. A simple website or application having plain text and a boring theme is not what people like nowadays. Any website or application should consist of engaging, user-friendly elements to surf well in the vast ocean of the internet. To maintain the requirements of rapidly developing technology, some new-age developers worked hard to build something top-notch yet user-friendly to ease the programmer&#8217;s tasks. Therefore, developers invented the faster and more operative website development framework of Javascript, Mean Stack. The benefit is that the main stack works best in easing the job of developers and users. This purpose-serving framework stands at the peak of demands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in becoming a mean stack developer, you should first learn what a mean stack, its components, and its benefits are, then decide whether pursuing a role in this field is right for you or not. Here we have rounded up the complete guide about mean stack and <a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development"><strong>mean stack developer</strong></a>, sharing details about the skills required and others.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Mean Stack?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perfect solution for creating dynamic applications and websites is the user-friendly stack called “Mean Stack.” The mean stack, aka a collection of JavaScript technologies, is used to develop fast and robust web-based applications and primarily for cloud-ready applications. MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js. Thus, from client to server and from server to database, everything in the mean stack framework is based on JavaScript.</span></p>
<h3><b>Components of Mean Stack</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four technology pieces in the mean stack include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>MongoDB </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">express is a NoSQL database system which does not contain relations or schema options. Additionally, it consists of a coherent way of sorting out data in a highly organized matter. You can save a large amount of unorganized data here by using JavaScript.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Express JS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a framework used to build websites and web applications in Node.js. The framework allows users to create the website in the most customizable way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this incredible platform is open source; you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can use Express JS to retrieve data, query databases or responses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>AngularJS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a JavaScript open-source framework for front-end activities developed by Google. The framework is used to formulate one-page sites and applications; also, you can fix web application bugs and resolve front-end issues with Angular JS.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Node.js</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a super easy back-end platform capable of reading and executing code to help function sites and web applications. You can use this framework to create any sort of website and application; the best part is its readily available and open-source platform. </span></li>
</ul>
