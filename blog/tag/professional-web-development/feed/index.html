										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we can witness the latest and updated information with every single tap. A simple website or application having plain text and a boring theme is not what people like nowadays. Any website or application should consist of engaging, user-friendly elements to surf well in the vast ocean of the internet. To maintain the requirements of rapidly developing technology, some new-age developers worked hard to build something top-notch yet user-friendly to ease the programmer&#8217;s tasks. Therefore, developers invented the faster and more operative website development framework of Javascript, Mean Stack. The benefit is that the main stack works best in easing the job of developers and users. This purpose-serving framework stands at the peak of demands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in becoming a mean stack developer, you should first learn what a mean stack, its components, and its benefits are, then decide whether pursuing a role in this field is right for you or not. Here we have rounded up the complete guide about mean stack and <a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development"><strong>mean stack developer</strong></a>, sharing details about the skills required and others.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Mean Stack?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perfect solution for creating dynamic applications and websites is the user-friendly stack called “Mean Stack.” The mean stack, aka a collection of JavaScript technologies, is used to develop fast and robust web-based applications and primarily for cloud-ready applications. MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js. Thus, from client to server and from server to database, everything in the mean stack framework is based on JavaScript.</span></p>
<h3><b>Components of Mean Stack</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four technology pieces in the mean stack include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>MongoDB </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">express is a NoSQL database system which does not contain relations or schema options. Additionally, it consists of a coherent way of sorting out data in a highly organized matter. You can save a large amount of unorganized data here by using JavaScript.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Express JS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a framework used to build websites and web applications in Node.js. The framework allows users to create the website in the most customizable way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this incredible platform is open source; you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can use Express JS to retrieve data, query databases or responses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>AngularJS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a JavaScript open-source framework for front-end activities developed by Google. The framework is used to formulate one-page sites and applications; also, you can fix web application bugs and resolve front-end issues with Angular JS.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Node.js</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a super easy back-end platform capable of reading and executing code to help function sites and web applications. You can use this framework to create any sort of website and application; the best part is its readily available and open-source platform. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>What is Mean Stack Developer?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mean stack developer is a technical professional with vast expertise in stack tools. In addition, mean developers have extensive knowledge of JavaScript frameworks and associated programs to create top-notch websites and applications. The mean developers&#8217; specialty is working on both the front-end and back-end of JavaScript applications. There are several responsibilities of a mean developer that include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architect, test, and create robust, highly responsive applications that can grow in size quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design and maintain large, complex databases for clients where they can store or retrieve data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify and fix production and non-production application issues as part of the deployment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrate and establish existing applications with other sites and software as needed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deploy applications on AWS cloud with the ability to remove errors and other hosting-related issues. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Mean Stack Developer VS Full-Stack Developer</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mean developer is a full stack developer that focuses and uses MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js for website creation. They have knowledge of some specific parts of <a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development"><strong>web development</strong></a>. In contrast, full-stack developers know all web development stages but are not experts on all layers of development. Full-stack developers only possess the functional knowledge and expertise that helps them build a web application. In addition, the full-stack developers contain vast skills in basic web technologies like CSS/HTML, JavaScript, databases, back-end language, and web storage. Moreover, they have knowledge of web application architecture, HTTP, basic algorithms and data structures, REST, and Git.</span></p>
<h2><b>Skills That a Mean Stack Developer Should Have</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are numerous essential skills that a mean developer should have if he wants to excel in their role. Try following these skills to be an expert in mean development and pursue this career ideally.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>JavaScript: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, mean stack is all about JavaScript, which means if you want to become a mean stack developer, you should have command of the JavaScript coding language. Deep knowledge of JavaScript is essential; you must know coding and should be aware of using related tools, including third-party libraries and databases. </span></li>
<li><b>Mean Stack Expertise:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ability to work with MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js.</span></li>
<li><b>Web Technologies:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To become a mean developer, you should have the necessary knowledge of web technologies like internet servers, protocols, and cloud technology. Similarly, you should know cloud architecture deeply and must learn how to program applications that can function on different devices. </span></li>
<li><b>Research Skills: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, people ignore research skills, but it&#8217;s crucial for a mean developer to know how to research. It often happens when a developer is stuck in a problem and can&#8217;t find the solution; the research skills work there. A great mean stack developer will identify the problem and use the research platforms to see how to get rid of the issue. A simple search can save you long hours and make you out of a particular problem. </span></li>
<li><b>Communication and Collaboration Skills: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a mean developer, you must communicate with clients and understand their unique requirements. So your communication skills should be on point. Also, you can manage a team of developers perfectly under your supervision and build new top-notch software if you communicate and collaborate properly with the team.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">C++</h2>



<p>The origination of the C++ programming language was in 1985. Core to which blockchain development came into being for developers to get luxurious dealings includes the variety of aspects in developing cryptocurrency—conventionally made with OOP&#8217;s methodical creating such as Ripple, Stellar, Bitcoin, etc. Moreover, the efficiency, primitive improvements, runtime polymorphism, and object orientation like featural functioning are what C++ language is advancing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">JAVA</h2>



<p>The intelligent integration in languages runs on hassle-free possibilities, including a more effortless functioning that web developers are fond of adopting in seeking the correct basis of methodologies adaption. But, first, classic programming and a known android application are developing language in extensive libraries, namely object-oriented, easy cache cleaner, concurrent, and fundamentally flexible coding binary language.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">JavaScript</h2>



<p>Redundant in sources, the main visuals are under the millennials&#8217; acceptability in programming languages that are highly capable and creative blockchain developing articulation. The popularity is among blockchain developers with Node.JS frameworks. Similarly, with this elaboration, web development in programming languages- JavaScript enhances scalability by focusing on the logic the language application illustrates in the economics of blockchain development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">PYTHON</h2>



<p>The language runs on smart contracts and is open-source to easily readable applications. Python plays a rich role in figuring out this phenomenon in language programming, helping developers to have easy-access dynamical architectural functioning. However, developers need to start as freshies to achieve loathed success in the field, which offers the liberty of carrying blockchain development firsthand from the creation date in 1991—simultaneously having a probable base and scripting approaches.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">SOLIDITY</h2>



<p>Estimating programming at 200,000 streamlines has gained an up-thrusting boost to the language in helping understand blockchain development and features. Moreover, the language has the possibility of having a contractual meaning with programming language running on EVM- Ethereum Virtual Machine. Solidity gives you ease in statistic programming, precise accuracy, inheritance in contractual possibilities, debuggers, and developers ease to have the subject in the exemplary illustration of programming language.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CX- PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2>



<p>A complete and credible fit in programming language signification stems from simplicity in contractual intermediaries in pointers, arrays, and propelled processes.

<p>Are you wondering about having your platform to market your product? Is the deal between <strong><a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shopify and Magento</a></strong> averse? We will search through the integrations they relate at the ratio of finding this comparison to be answered with a suitable answer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magento</h2>



<p>An eCommerce platform where you have the leverage to market your product based on various professional revivals, Magento is a platform where business officials are obliged to work at coding interprets. Moreover, on a Business marketing basis, Magento is a great substitute for reaching out through B2B to B2C integrations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Shopify</h2>



<p>Listing the probabilities, Shopify is the most versatile platform for a sole proprietorship. Businesses starting from scratch; you opt to sell your products with low pricing delegations. Shopify is your place; you&#8217;re provided with ease of socializing your product and with the best combinations. Foremost, Shopify has linked Oberlo, opting to serve you many features in running your product to reach the customers at hand.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which Is Best: Shopify or Magento?</h2>



<p>Listing these chances, Shopify and Magento being the best eCommerce platform of this age, have an upsurge of similarities and dissimilarities; you find them at ease to run your business essentials. They provide you with the best platform. But, some points make one different from another. The difference depends on functionality, prices, theme extracts, add-ons, advertisements, and sales.</p>



<p>Ominous to these verdicts is the potential sense of giving this liberty to the businesses to run on an easy probability of reaching the targeted market. We must look through many variations and have the liberty to customize and combine the designed optimizations that attract other platforms to do business and upgrade at best.</p>



<p>Shopify putting ideal and rare deals to manage their reputation has resulted in multiple sourcing domains. Firstly, Shopify plans to flourish in the market by uprooting a great percentage of users in plenty of running businesses like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. While Magento eCommerce has many businesses prompts, it&#8217;s easy to understand professional web coding.</p>



<p>These verdicts enlarge the overall pacing of both platforms to have a rundown value and become cost-effective, flexible, and ideally approachable for the audience. Still, both lose something and have virtuous phenomena in another.</p>



<p>We can see the ratio of installation category to both platforms; Shopify takes the win-win centrum in most of these integrations, making it the right choice for the user to pursue. Both platforms have unwillingly paced the structural work to lookup the marketing strategy crashing with one another. Also, it can identify both the domains to have real deal functionality structure.</p>



<p>Enhancement of interest from both ends- consumer and business, both of these mediums play an important role in the development. The possibility is that Magento and Shopify are providing the audience the liberty. Professionals witness Shopify allows a minor to have access, whereas Magento licensing is a must-to-have entity.</p>



<p>Pricing depends on the features and add-ons; Shopify gives the audience leverage to work on a 14-days free trial. Meanwhile, Magento is diligently making the user control their audience and requires learning indictments.</p>



<p>These giants offer progressive services with open-sourcing effects; Shopify and Magento have set their standards concrete. Shopify takes the lead position and takes over an equal ratio with performance conclusions, making these possible integrations.</p>



<p>Many innovative developments are incorporated with dealt integrations; <strong><a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e Commerce services</a></strong> are useful to the user, including UI motion, support-to-code optimization, AMP (Accelerated Mobile Page), etc. which are th3e features of Shopify. On the other hand, Magento offers gripping and rightful integrations in the e-Commerce services that keep it in the marketplace. When e-Commerce is the subject, primary and underlining features matter a lot, but the improvements they offer to their characteristics are best in both platforms. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Verdict</h2>



<p>Shopify and Magento keep evolving because they have a broad range of improvising space- many improvements have been made. In contrast, many are on their way to integration and executions. So it will be easy for consumers to look at what you&#8217;re looking for and find the right deal to move forward with your business with the above features. Moreover, a business&#8217;s necessary attractiveness to reach out to trillions of other <strong><a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eCommerce professional developments</a></strong> has accelerated it. So they&#8217;re upgrading in the high range with these platforms. Have to look at a complete image of these transitions, search it away, and enjoy the journey ahead to success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>People are constantly confused when using terms of the technological realm like&#8221;<strong>web designer</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>web developer</strong>.&#8221; Even though both jobs are from the same industry, i.e., the computer sciences (information and computer technology) world, the difference between them is as clearly visibly different as the sun and moon. Both of these jobs require highly-competitive, logical, and analytical skillsets.</p>



<p>People with sharp minds who can easily comprehend the logical aspects of Web development and have a knack for artistic sights work on both of these jobs simultaneously, but both these jobs are opposites. Instead, they are complementary. So when people use the terms &#8220;<em>web designer&#8221;</em>&nbsp;vs. &#8220;<em>web developer</em>&#8221; conversely, they are stirring a hornet&#8217;s nest because this is unjustifiable.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to understand Web designing; a business needs an entire team to design and launch a complex, interactive website. For Web Development, a team of a minimum of two and a maximum of fifteen members fifteen (or more) is required.</p>



<p>The Web Development professi<a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">onals</a> involved in the procedure include web designers, copywriters, web developers, SEO professionals, or if unsure, hire dedicated developers for projects. Branding and branding strategy is part of the same process too. Thus, it&#8217;s easy to see how misunderstanding emerges when analyzing what a web designer does differently from a web developer and vice-versa. To make things understandable and use these terms correctly, this article is here to make things more obvious.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Web Designer</h2>



<p><a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web designing</a> is just about anything that requires an aesthetic eye and artistic flair. Moreover, web designers work with the visuals of a website while also ensuring that the site is user-friendly and straightforward so visitors can interact with it.</p>



<p>The job of a Web designer is critical- they need to make sure that visitors&#8217; retention rate keeps on increasing; they must be able to find things they wish quick and spend more time on a website. To do this, they analyze the most modern trends in web design, acknowledge design principles and standards, follow users&#8217; demands explicitly while making the website, and much more. Web designers generate layouts and visuals that are visually appealing for the visitors while keeping in mind how they will feel while browsing the site.</p>



<p>There are three categories of Web Designers: UX, UI, and VD/GD (Visual/<a href="https://geeksroot.com/graphic-design.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Graphic Designer</a>). Here&#8217;s a short description of them:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">User Experience (UX)</h2>



<p>User Experience (UX) designers ensure that a website keeps visitors engaged and boosts organic traffic. They carefully evaluate data and information and trends before putting things into practice. Furthermore, UX designers run complexly detailed assessments and streamline the websites to optimize the user experience for better sales and company reputation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">User Interface (UI)</h2>



<p>User Interface (UI) designers handle how well users can interact with the features present on the website. The User Interface (UI) is everything visitors see when visiting a website. Therefore, the website needs to be visually appealing and seamlessly fit to get the expected workflow.</p>



<p>A UX and a UI designer&#8217;s responsibilities can be combined into one job, making an individual profile – the Visual/GraphicDesigner. Visual Design produces visually attractive and suitable interfaces for visitors to use. Also, they must keep in mind the needs and requirements of the brand.Visual/Graphic design skills include both creativity and coding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Web Developer &amp; Development</h2>



<p>The definition of a web development developer is reasonably related to that of a web designer. Web developers have an essential role in website development and creation. They manage the process&#8217;s execution and implementation stages. After deciphering the goals and structure of the website, web developers can go into the next phase to transform the concept and make it a reality.</p>



<p>Understanding the Web Designer vs.Web Developer comparison hinges on this distinction mentioned above.</p>



<ul><li>To bring every aspect of the wbsite together, let&#8217;s take a look at a quick breakdown of the most significant distinctions between these two roles:</li><li>Web designers focus on look, usability, and appearance, whereas web developers focus on the functionality and structure of the website.</li><li>Web designers conceptualize the website&#8217;s look, designing a prototype based on graphical, UX, and UI features. Then, web development specialists determine whether the concept is fiscally and technically credible, program and code the website.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Web developers require a substantial amount of technical knowledge. It is because it contains understanding new and complex programming languages and frameworks. However, research and analysis showed that web designer&#8217;s role is less technical and all about visual and creative elements.</li></ul>



<ul><li>There are different categories of web developers, including Front-end, Back-end, and Full-stack Developers. However, UX, UI, and Graphic/Visual designers are the three principal web designers.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The tools and programs used by web developers include programming libraries and frameworks, coding QA and versioning, error/bug tracking platforms such as GitHub, hosting management panels, FTP clients, and CMSs. However, web designers usually use design editing software such as Photoshop, WordPress (or any other CMS), a website builder such as Elementor, and wireframing/prototyping tools.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Web developers and designers are responsible for developing, deploying, and maintaining websites. But ultimately, the two functions depend on each other to deliver a quality product.</li></ul>



<p>The main difference is that <a href="https://geeksroot.com/web-development.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web Development</a> focuses on the website&#8217;s technical attributes, such as programming. On the other hand, Web designers manage the visuals and conceptual workings; necessary to ensure a solid UX and UI customer experience.</p>

<p>User interface design UI (user interface) is closely related to UX (user experience). A study shows that online businesses with a good quality ensure a competitive edge in the progressively competitive and evolving environment. The UI designs aim to create digital interactions as uncomplicated, seamless, spontaneous, and effective as possible. Thus, the design must predict needs and guarantee simplicity inaccessibility, ability, and use, augmenting the UX.</p>



<p>The more perceptive the understanding of the target audience is, <a href="https://geeksroot.com/graphic-design.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UI/UX designers</a> can make influential interfaces with robust website profiles. Thus, the interface must have a user-centric design, irrespective of the usage medium (a website, an app, or software). Furthermore, a professional UI design should be gradual. The UI aims to guarantee quick and easy access to whatever the user wants. Hence, the user interface shouldn’t be a barrier but a path.</p>



<p>There are many benefits of UI/UX designs; here, we’re listing five of the most common yet effective advantages/benefits of UI designs for a business:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">UI Design Boost in Customer Retention &amp; Engagement</h2>



<p>Easy navigation gives customers ease in searching for what they’re looking for; hence the engagement is more robust, and the retention rate increases. With a professional UI/UX design, the development of a website is made keeping in mind the straightforward build. This way, the bounce probability is minimal, and the conversion rate is higher. An ergonomic UI promotes customer engagement leading towards more loyal to the brand. Businesses need to invest in customer retention approaches in the existing digital environment, growing competition, and quick technological advancements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Productivity Enhancements</h2>



<p>Presenting the best UI/UX design, combined with cost-effective application development with resources, is essential as it leads to productivity enhancements. This productivity is manifested in both the user and the business. For example, Anintelligibleinterface and simple navigation help users search quickly, increasing satisfaction and fulfilling their needs instantly and professionally. As a result, the company boosts sales volume leading to improved customer loyalty and minimizing costs and assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New Customer Acquisition</h2>



<p>A professionally-developed UI design contributes to an affirmative user experience, a competitive lead in the online business realm. In addition, the attempt to deliver a personalized UI to a customer is a business component differentiator. Thus, it draws new customers and subsequently increases sales. Therefore, the gamble on UI design can make or break a business, enhance enterprise, increase revenue opportunities, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Development Expense Reduction</h2>



<p>A carefully designed avoids potential problems. It includes training that a customer needs, UI support for navigation errors correction, reducing irrelevant features, and design modification to be simple and functional. But, all of these features involve expenses. Thus, intuitive UI benefits both users and businesses because designers have fewer UI problems and avoid additional fixing costs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lesser Cost of Customer Support</h2>



<p>Generally, users communicate doubts or problems when navigating a website’s interface. However, if it’s intuitive, customer contact integrated with the support assistance will be the least. As a result, the company will benefit from costs reduction in the customer support module. A simple and functional UIdiminishes error frequency and unnecessary actions in the navigation process, preventing customer support costs.</p>



<p>UI/UX designers’ job description doesn’t involve coding or programming of any kind, but it is incredibly useful if they have the “programming know-how” skills. Depending on the product’s nature, it’s also common for UI/UX design and its development to be connected into a streamlined particular process. Although design and development involve various skill sets, knowing both is increasingly crucial to the technological designs industry. The process is simple- web developers must understand the web design requirements of coding. Likewise, <a href="https://geeksroot.com/graphic-design.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UI/UXcompanies and designers</a> need to understand what designs are feasible from the backend point of view.</p>



<p>But, the question “which language is best for UI design?”; here’s the answer. However, there isn’t a particular language applied for UI design in the general sense. If a designer is designing for the web, it can benefit significantly from a good and sound knowledge of HTML and CSS, even if it’s employed to communicate with the team. In almost every imaginable UI design situation, UI/UX designers work in an environment packed with programmers who code things they design. The more effectively a designer can understand and communicate their ideas to the dev team, and the more effectively they can develop their ideas in visuals, the better it is for all.</p>
